# Where's The Bus?

A niche transit app for Android which allows users to quickly get bus times by tapping their compass card to their phone. 
This app gets the bus schedule in the shortest time possible, allowing the user to skip texting Translink or checking their mapping app.
This app uses NFC functionality with your compass card; tapping it on your phone automatically opens the app and immediately texts a nearby bus stop. 
This allows the user to bypass inconveniences such as wearing gloves on a cold day, or not being able to see the stop number properly when it’s dark at night. 
Where’s The Bus is the fastest way to get bus times, with the least input possible.
